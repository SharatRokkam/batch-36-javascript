// console.log('working')

// if you create a variable using var, it can redeclared and it can be reintialized

// var firstVariable; //declaration
// firstVariable = 20; //assigning some value means intialization
// console.log(firstVariable);
// var firstVariable = 100; declared and intialized in the same line 

// var second = 10;
// var second = 20;
// console.log(second);

// This is not best thing to do as redeclaration and reinitialization can cause errors and confusion...

// let and const - ES6

// What is difference es5 and es6
// var is introduced in before es6 and let const were introduced in es6

// let and const

//let can be reinitialized and we cannot redeclare it..

// let first = "Hello";
// let  first = 10;

// console.log(first);


// const cannot redeclared and cannot be reinitialized , it should be declared and intialized on the same line.

const a = 'sting';
// a = 100;


console.log(a)
